I could have never predicted what the next decade would bring. Today, just 10 years later, millions of people use cloud computing to deliver services, respond to disasters, expand access to education, and more. Secure computing is now available on demand to virtually anyone at a cost that allows for rapid experimentation.</p>\r\n",

But these could well be images shot in Ethiopia or another impoverished or drought-affected nation. Most of us do not see women and children walking several kilometers each day to fetch water from a distant well or lake. With pots stacked on their heads and cans strapped to cattle, they spend much time collecting water every day, and that&rsquo;s one reason children do not attend school. The water at that resource is usually not potable and causes water-borne diseases. Around the world, 785 million people do not have access to clean water. It&rsquo;s quite common to see cattle and humans consuming water from the same resource in India. While there is groundwater or water in wells, it takes a considerable effort to draw it out from the ground, as pumps are few in number or broken. A successful project undertaken by non-profit Charity: water in Ethiopia could be the solution to this problem. The project uses smart pumps with IoT enabled devices and cloud analytics. The IoT devices are designed by AWS partner Twisthink, an innovation design firm. And the cloud services are provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services). There is a partner ecosystem that handles other aspects of the project, like distribution, installation, and maintenance of the water pumps.</p>\r\n",

In the 2000s, he was part of a team that analyzed chest x-rays of SARS patients. When COVID-19 started spreading in January, he teamed up with Dr. William Parker, a radiology resident at the University of British Columbia.

In the past, a distinction has been made between OT, Operational Technology, or IT, Information Technology, and the product, the financing. They were all in their silos and had their tasks. Nowadays you can work in Operational Technology and have your own IT. Every project manager today can also deal with financing issues. These things are closely related. In the past, people budgeted that they could spend X million euros. If you go into the modern, cloud-based infrastructure, on demand, then you only pay for what you use.&quot;</p>\r\n",

The tool, called Spotlight, uses text- and image-processing algorithms to match faces and other clues in online sex ads with other evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using Amazon&rsquo;s facial recognition technology, Spotlight quickly returned a list of online sex ads featuring the girl&rsquo;s photo.

The nonprofit was cofounded in 2009 by actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher and has become influential with both law enforcement&mdash;who can use Spotlight and other tools for free&mdash;and the tech industry.

Zhang Xia, AWS&#39;s chief cloud computing business consultant, said that even those who do not have a strong background in learning can use the SageMaker platform to make the training process of AI simple, and even directly select three models that are pre-trained by AWS. Train the selected track and given parameters. &quot;AWS wants to make AI easier and more popular through the DeepRacer competition.&quot;</p>\r\n",

There the company will use its Amazon Rekognition service to examine every frame of content and automatically tag who or what is within.&nbsp; AWS will also use their own proprietary voice recognition service to transcribe interviews or broadcasts of races.

In this method, the machine learns by being given a high reward function when it performs an ideal action. For example, if the position of the car is within 10% of the center line; 1.0 points are given, and if it is within 25%, 0.5 points are given. The location of the center line is recognized with images taken by the onboard camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;AWS has invested in machine learning for 20 years,&rdquo; said Yoichi Takizawa, Senior Manager, Principal Solutions Architect of AWS Japan. &ldquo;We developed this service because we wanted to bring reinforcement learning to all developers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

That was the case with the county&rsquo;s existing call center, which had existed on-prem for more than a decade, said Benny Chacko, deputy general manager of the Internal Services Department (ISD). A contact center, Chacko added, could enable &ldquo;multiple modes of contact&rdquo; including text, mobile and online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was more of an opportunity to really leverage that type of newer technology as it relates to cloud-based contact centers, see how can we really get rid of those standard types of calls or those types of actions that our agents would typically have to take or receive those calls. And have those handled through some kind of automated fashion through artificial intelligence (AI),&rdquo; Chacko said. The agency partnered with Presidio and Amazon Web Services in late 2018 to deploy the latter&rsquo;s AWS Connect; and, though the rollout is ongoing, it is already seeing benefits in how AI and machine learning can streamline communication.</p>\r\n",

The idea with the Ground Truth tools is to make it easier to label datasets that are used to train these machine learning models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth, developers can build more accurate datasets to train models for tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and others. Essentially what the service does is provide workflows and interfaces that enable labeling tasks to be automated.

Has meaningful progress been made?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AWS works with just about every agency of the federal government and we&rsquo;re seeing meaningful progress in IT modernization happening throughout. It&rsquo;s been about a decade since the 25-point plan and the cloud-first strategy came out, and in the early days what we were seeing was agencies were doing individual&nbsp;workloads, and they were taking some fairly low-risk things and they were moving it into the cloud. Today what we&rsquo;re seeing is widespread adoption. From those early successes they realized the benefits of moving to the cloud. Now we&rsquo;re seeing many mission-critical applications moving to the cloud. For example, just last week Defense Health Agency announced that they moved a critical system, an Impact Level 4 FISMA moderate system, that&rsquo;s really important so that the military families can get their healthcare paid for. And now what we&rsquo;re seeing is not only that these things are happening but now agencies are taking advantage of some of these new technologies. So for example, DHS Citizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, they&rsquo;ve moved into a DevOps agile mode, and what&rsquo;s happening today is they&rsquo;re constantly iterating. It&rsquo;s my hope that sometime in the future we no longer even have to have an IT Modernization conference, because modernization will be a critical part or an integral part of operation maintenance moving forward.</p>\r\n",

Bezos said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Much of what we build at AWS is based on listening to customers. It&rsquo;s critical to ask customers what they want, listen carefully to their answers, and figure out a plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly (speed matters in business!). No business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession. But it&rsquo;s also not enough. The biggest needle movers will be things that customers don&rsquo;t know to ask for.

Yes, its Alexa competes with Siri and the company offers predictive services in its cloud. But the algorithms most critical to the company&rsquo;s success are those it uses to constantly streamline its own operations. The feedback loop looks the same as in its consumer-facing AI: build a service, attract customers, gather data, and let computers learn from these data, all at a scale that human labour could not emulate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AWS&rsquo;s chief use of machine learning is to forecast demand for computation. Insufficient computing power as internet users flock to a customer&rsquo;s service can engender errors&mdash;and lost sales as users encounter error pages. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re out of stock,&rdquo; says Andy Jassy, AWS&rsquo;s boss. To ensure they never have to, Mr Jassy&rsquo;s team crunches customer data. Amazon cannot see what is hosted on its servers, but it can monitor how much traffic each of its customers gets, how long the connections last and how solid they are. As in its fulfilment centres, these metadata feed machine-learning models which predict when and where AWS is going to see demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of AWS&rsquo;s biggest customers is Amazon itself. And one of the main things other Amazon businesses want is predictions. Demand is so high that AWS has designed a new chip, called Inferentia, to handle these tasks. Mr Jassy says that Inferentia will save Amazon money on all the machine-learning tasks it needs to run in order to keep the lights on, as well as attracting customers to its cloud services. &ldquo;We believe it can be at least an order-of-magnitude improvement in cost and efficiency,&rdquo; he says. The algorithms which recognise voices and understand human language in Alexa will be one big beneficiary.</p>\r\n",

And Capgemini finished at the top of the podium with 1st and 3rd place. Two students, Arthur Pace (UTT) and Matthieu Rousseau (ISEP), interns at Capgemini AIE (Application Innovation Exchange) directed by Jean-Claude Guyard, developed the miracle algorithm. The two winners will participate in the Las Vegas world final in November 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its competition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provided participants with a dedicated service on AWS Sagemaker to develop their own artificial intelligence, based on reinforcement learning. The concept: a neural network predicts one of the multiple possible movements of the car (accelerate, slow down, turn left, etc.) followed by a reward function that evaluates the error made by the car at each iteration (Is the car in the middle of the track? Is it moving fast? etc.). Progressively as attempts are made, the car learns to move between the two white lines. Capgemini AEI is currently working on innovation projects around disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, robotics, augmented and virtual reality, 3D printing, etc.).</p>\r\n",

          "Description": "<p>&ldquo;New ways of using data will change the world. The more data migrate to the cloud, the more innovation we will see in the business areas and areas where we never expect it to happen. Now cloud computing is not an optional but an essential infrastructure for businesses,&rdquo; said Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, Vice President for Amazon S3 in an interview with Maeil Business Newspaper on March 13. She highlighted cloud technology as a key enabler to drive innovation for the next 5-10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec is responsible for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), the world&rsquo;s first cloud storage service launched 13 years ago by AWS. This service is expanding its scope beyond simple data storage to data collection and analytics. What makes Amazon S3 outstanding in the market is that the technical expertise and know-how have been built for more than a decade by working with many customers. Today business agility and flexibility obtained through cloud migration have become essential for companies of all sizes to survive in the market. If you merely think of cloud adoption as a way for cost reduction or do not even consider it, you will inevitably fall behind and lose competitive edge because it means you will miss enormous opportunities that cloud adoption will bring, such as drawing more business insights and spurring innovation for new features, services and products by analyzing the data on cloud.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

We&rsquo;re using technology to make it easier for people to stay healthy. This new announcement with Amazon, using Amazon Lex technology, allows us to have people check their blood pressure at home, use a cellular connection that is automatic in the product to connect it and send it to wherever they want to the cloud. We call it Cuff to Cloud. The nice thing is they&rsquo;re using voice technology, which we know is the most natural way to communicate with any technology. In healthcare, it&rsquo;s not about the technology. It&rsquo;s about how we use it to make it easier for people to stay healthy. It&rsquo;s a great development,&quot; said Livongo Executive Chairman Glen Tullman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

With global cloud expertise and unmatched reliability, security, and performance, AWS in combination with LG CNS&rsquo;s leadership in building and operating domestic IT systems, will help Korean businesses plan for, and execute effective migration strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, LG CNS will launch a program that provides methodology, training, and consultation services to help companies move 50 applications in 50 days. LG CNS expects to migrate 50 of its own internal applications and workloads to AWS. It will then apply the same practice to drive the digital transformation projects within companies in LG Group and other domestic customers and expand the business to the Asia Pacific market. LG CNS and AWS will also explore opportunities to accelerate innovation by creating new solutions in emerging fields such as 5G, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Internet of Things, and Smart Factory.</p>\r\n",

The goal will be to get students ready for entry-level tech roles &ndash; like those at Amazon or elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program, which begins this fall, will be offered to the tens of thousands of students across these universities, Amazon says. In addition, LAGCC will partner with at least one New York City high school to offer concurrent enrollment in the 15-credit certificate program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the new high school courses are being funded through the Amazon Future Engineer program, this certificate program for college students is being handled through Amazon&rsquo;s AWS Educate program. The Educate program is today being used by over 1,500 institutions to train students in cloud computing by offering them hands-on experience in AWS technology.

AWS PrivateLink, a networking technology, is aimed at facilitating access to AWS services in a highly scalable and available way, while still keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network. So, when users develop AWS PrivateLink endpoints for ECR and ECS, these service endpoints will appear as elastic network interfaces with a private IP address in their VPC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before AWS PrivateLink, Amazon EC2 instances had to route traffic via the public internet to download Docker images stored in ECR or communicate to the ECS control plane. But with the addition of AWS PrivateLink support, instances in both private as well as public subnets can use it to attain private connectivity to download images from Amazon ECR, thus bypassing the public internet. Furthermore, with AWS PrivateLink, traffic doesn&rsquo;t traverse the Internet; this helps minimize the exposure to threats like distributed denial-of-service and brute force attacks.</p>\r\n",

WorkLink the goes to work, securely requests that site and &mdash; and that&rsquo;s the smart part here &mdash; a secure WorkLink container converts the site into an interactive vector graphic and sends it back to the phone. Nothing is stored or cached on the phone and AWS says WorkLink knows nothing about personal device activity either.

For those responsible for IT, one of the decisive factors for success is precise monitoring of the cloud environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vehicles, real estate, insurance, financial products - dealers can provide a broad portfolio via the online marketplaces of Scout24 AG. The portal operator began moving its infrastructures to the cloud early on. The migration from AutoScout24 to a platform from Amazon Web Services (AWS) started in 2014. With the relocation of ImmobilienScout24, the company initiated another major project, this time with a completely new strategy. In contrast to the AutoScout24 migration, the following applies to the real estate portal: first move, then optimize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CIOs rarely have to come up with the art of persuasion when they want to move IT infrastructure to the cloud: Advantages such as high reliability, the versatile possibilities for automation, comprehensive recovery functions or cost transparency thanks to the pay-per-use model speak for themselves. The same applies to Scout24: &ldquo;The relocation of ImmobilienScout24 to the AWS cloud gives us significantly more flexibility. High pre-financing costs or excessive hardware investments are no longer an issue for us,&rdquo; explains Johannes Br&uuml;ck, Principal Platform Engineer at Scout24. The IT professional sees an additional bonus in the high speed with which the Scout24 development teams can now develop new products. Scout24 relies on agile development processes, which not only require flexibility in the work processes, but also in the underlying infrastructures.</p>\r\n",

According to a newly released statement by Matt Wood, an eight-year veteran of Amazon and a general manager of deep learning and AI at the company, there are more than 45 hours across 30 different courses that developers, data scientists, data platform engineers and business professionals can take gratis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he explains them, each &ldquo;starts with the fundamentals, and builds on those through real-world examples and labs, allowing developers to explore machine learning through some fun problems we have had to solve at Amazon. These include predicting gift wrapping eligibility, optimizing delivery routes, or predicting entertainment award nominations using data from IMDb (an Amazon subsidiary). Coursework helps consolidate best practices, and demonstrates how to get started on a range of AWS machine learning services, including Amazon SageMaker, AWS DeepLens, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Comprehend.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Having won a $600 million cloud deal with the CIA in 2013, the company is considered the frontrunner to win the U.S. Defense Department&rsquo;s $10 billion JEDI project. Having a datacenter region &mdash; one that is built for hosting sensitive data &mdash; closer to Washington, D.C. can only help its cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, AWS also announced plans to open datacenters in Italy in 2020, which is in addition to other regions that are currently under construction around the world, including Bahrain, Hong Kong, Sweden, and Cape Town, where its first African datacenters are expected to go into operation in 2020.</p>\r\n",

Research in cutting-edge areas like machine learning continues to demonstrate that computers have the potential to predict outcomes and enhance physicians&rsquo; performance in a wide range of tasks.

Saurabh Gupta, chief information officer at Kent, however, wanted to give the environment a more &ldquo;flexible footing&rdquo;. Kent chose Amazon Web Services (AWS) after a review of cloud-service providers. Kent now has more agility with its CRM solution because of AWS.

This is a huge deal which should simplify the deployment, operations, and scaling of databases in VMware-based datacenters, making it easier to migrate them to either AWS or VMware Cloud on AWS. The crux of Amazon RDS is that it automates database management wherever the database is deployed, which could save customers significant time and trouble. This new service will support a variety of leading databases, including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB. During the General Session, VMware gave a demonstration of how Amazon RDS runs on VMware in a private datacenter. VMware says that this essentially gives developers &ldquo;a familiar RDS functionality&rdquo; on VMware, in both private datacenters and Edge environments. Now we have AWS Greengrass and now RDS to run on-prem. And we thought AWS just operated in their own cloud. Surprise! This should give every company in the on-prem space a moment of pause.</p>\r\n",

Amazon will charge by the second. Aurora Serverless will help businesses and platforms deal with<strong>&nbsp;</strong>sudden, unexpected traffic demands that might follow, say, a new app appearing in the App Store or a big story breaking on a news site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The feature will automatically start, adjust and stop<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a company&#39;s access to additional space when it notices an increase or decline in traffic. Retailers are a prime target for this feature because they don&#39;t always need tons of storage, but occasionally find the added capacity useful. Getting billed by the second can add up. But it could also help save dollars on slower days by preventing companies from buying more storage than they need -- or not buying enough.</p>\r\n",

Sales grew 49% from the year-ago quarter to $6.11 billion, and operating profit grew too, to $1.64 billion, up from $916 million. AWS got to brag about other important successes. For instance, AWS reminded everyone that it does have customers in the retail industry and that it just landed Zulily this quarter (a deal announced in June). Zulily is a Seattle based ecommerce site best known for its deals on women&#39;s and kids clothes. This deal is Amazon&#39;s way of saying that not every retailer is shunning it. Other retailers won&#39;t use AWS because parent company Amazon is a threat to them. Beyond a new retail customer, Amazon also noted that it scored two more companies that are ditching their own data centers to go &quot;all-in&quot; on AWS, Irish airline Ryanair and video game company Epic Games, the maker of the wildly popular Fortnite game.</p>\r\n",

Global research firm Gartner expects global spending on cloud computing to reach US$216 billion (7.22 trillion baht) in 2020, up from $111 billion in 2016.

The government had decided to move all 40 of its agencies to the cloud, becoming the first country to adopt a cloud-first policy in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are betting on the cloud. We&rsquo;re betting big on Amazon,&rdquo; said Salman Al-Khalifa, vice-chief executive officer of Bahrain Information and Government Authority. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not an oil-rich country. Our crown jewels are the citizens, and making them ready for the cloud is going to help us succeed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Containerization in the world of computing promises long-term portability and efficiency for software application deployment and distribution, but comes at the short-term cost of simultaneous infrastructure and organizational shifts that can throw businesses into temporary chaos without proper guidance. In an effort to minimize these issues and the enterprise learning curve around virtualization, Abby Fuller, senior technical evangelist at Amazon Web Services Inc., is leveraging her unique professional background to serve as an invested customer liaison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was a [developer operations] engineer right up until I took the job at AWS,&rdquo; Fuller said. &ldquo;Now I go around talking to customers and developers and other software engineers and teaching them how to use things. &hellip; I build my own demos; I write my own blog posts; I do all my own slides and workshops. &hellip; It&rsquo;s the best of all the worlds.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Each group exerts influence over cloud evolution, and the cloud shapes the needs of customers and the direction of technology transformation. Cloud improvements might make traditional data storage and retrieval activities become less visible, fading into a cloud of usage analogous to 19th-century military thinker Carl von Clausewitz&rsquo;s fog of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nature of the cloud lends itself to technology development, as it can serve as a giant test bed for datacentric applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are two disciplines that already are exploiting the cloud&rsquo;s features, and other applications are emerging. In turn, the appearance of innovative uses is influencing the cloud, and that influence is likely to increase as momentum builds to explore further applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the power of a software-defined infrastructure,&rdquo; asserts Mark Ryland, director, Office of the Chief Information Security Officer at Amazon Web Services (AWS). &ldquo;It enables a small number of clever programmers to build out systems that would have been impossible without an army of people buying and deploying hardware.</p>\r\n",

QuickSight will offer pay-per-session pricing to address users who have read-only access or may need to access dashboards less frequently. Pay-per-session pricing starts at 30 cents a session up to a maximum of $5 a month. Amazon QuickSight is more aimed at the business intelligence market, but the math can work for enterprises that are looking to provide dashboard access down the food chain.

AWS now offers six managed and generally available databases on its cloud service as well as a database migration service for moving hosted databases into the cloud. Graph databases are designed for applications that need to quickly make sense of the associations between different groups of data. They allow users to store related bits of data as a graph that can be accessed in a single operation, rather than a bunch of individual queries for all that data. Companies building social networks, fraud-detection apps or personalization features for existing apps, for example, can take advantage of graph databases to deliver more flexibility and speed.</p>\r\n",

The new features let Alexa take things a step further. For instance, if you&#39;re trying to set up a one-on-one appointment with a contact who&#39;s also shared calendar data with Amazon, Alexa will scan both of your schedules and suggest a time that&#39;d work for both of you. You can also move a meeting now without needing to delete it and create a new one -- just say something like, &quot;Alexa, move my meeting with Kate from 1:00 to 3:00.&quot; If doing so would leave you double-booked, Alexa will give you a heads-up.</p>\r\n",

The online retail giant said Wednesday that developers can now apply to test the voices, which were built to sound like U.S. English speakers. The point of having access to multiple Alexa voices is so developers can build skills (apps) in which users interact with a variety of voices instead of just one. For instance, if coders were to create interactive audio stories for Alexa, they could use the new voices to represent different characters, Amazon said. The new Alexa voices are part of the company&rsquo;s Polly service, which developers use to build skills (apps) for Alexa that can recognize text and convert it to a voice that can beam out of an Alexa-powered device like the Amazon Echo smart speaker. Amazon said that developers who are accepted to test the voices will be able to use them for free, but that will likely change when the voices are available to the general public to be used outside of a preview.</p>\r\n",

The infrastructure-as-a-service giant today announced the general availability of AWS IoT Analytics, a service for processing the data generated by devices in the &ldquo;internet of things.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s specifically designed to address the great deal of variety that exists in how different&nbsp;firms&nbsp;are applying their machine-generated information. IoT Analytics can ingest transmissions from a range of connected devices, including soil sensors and industrial equipment, and then ready the data for processing. The service lets companies customize various aspects of the preparation process, such as what readings to filter, based on their needs. Users can then employ the built-in analysis tools to start looking for patterns.</p>\r\n",

This will allow developers to customize those containers to better suit their own models and run them on local machines, rather than spending a bunch of money tweaking those models on the cloud.</p>\r\n",

          "Description": "<div>Oganizations can move large amounts of data to AWS via either a network connection or transportable drives. Because of the large quantities involved when an enterprise aggregates data, a Direct Connect high-speed, private link is the best network connection option, as speeds can reach up to 10 Gbps. Even when you use multi-gigabit network pipes, it takes time to replicate terabytes of data. For example, 20 TBs of data requires more than 51 hours to copy over a 1 Gbps link. AWS acknowledged the roadblock this presents to organizations with huge data footprints. Subsequently, the cloud provider unveiled <a href=\"http://searchaws.techtarget.com/definition/AWS-Import-Export-Snowball\">Snowball</a>, a portable, ruggedized hard drive and associated software, to simplify batch transfers of multi-terabyte data sets. Snowball, which comes in 50 TB and 80 TB sizes, includes a 10GBase-T network-attached storage connection, and its software enables you to use multiple devices in parallel to <a href=\"http://searchaws.techtarget.com/tip/Snowball-appliance-just-one-option-for-moving-data-to-AWS\">simplify the transfer</a> of 100-plus TB data sets.

It had to be easy to operate and to understand, extend, and scale.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nextdoor used machine learning models, Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic MapReduce, AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and Spark to create a &ldquo;trending post&rdquo; feature that notifies users of the top daily discussion in their neighborhood. Data is analyzed, transformed, and deposited into an Amazon DynamoDB data store that can be accessed by live production systems. Notification systems then read aggregate data and determine who should be notified. Additionally, the company found ways to improve its newsfeed experience by prioritizing more &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; conversations above others.</p>\r\n",

Looking for an alternative, the company selected AWS for better performance, scalability, and availability during peak periods, including weekends, New Year&rsquo;s Day, and summer months when users tend to use the Connected Fitness app the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Going all-in on AWS for Connected Fitness has enabled us to optimize all of our apps&mdash;including UA Record, MapMyFitness, Endomondo, and MyFitnessPal&mdash;along with an IoT hardware solution called HealthBox, which includes a scale, wristband, and heart rate monitor. It lets us deliver a seamless fitness experience to our global digital community, especially during peak seasons,&rdquo; says Jesse Demmel, vice president of platform engineering at Under Armour. Demmel added that AWS also provides a secure cloud platform for developing new products. &ldquo;With AWS, we can innovate faster to introduce the features our users are asking for, and we know we have the most secure, highest-performance cloud platform behind us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Previously, presidential campaigns had relied primarily on outside vendors for their software and operations. However, the president's team felt it needed to have faster access to the data it was generating and better control over how the campaign was run. It also wanted to write completely custom software for its volunteers in the field. So, about 18 months before the election, it started assembling a group of programmers to develop software for nearly every part of its operations: website, mailing list management, donations processing, canvassing, and field worker support.

Understanding the cloud will determine whether it helps organizations realize the efficiencies and cost savings it promises or the opportunities that float on by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form, cloud computing enables organizations to purchase computing power and data storage services from third-party providers who offer these products via the Internet. Rather than investing in their own data centers or servers, businesses and agencies can pay as they go, which allows them to expand\u2014or contract\u2014as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis business model offers several benefits; among the most attractive are lower upfront costs and increased agility. Organizations no longer have to predict how many servers they may need when their business grows. Yet, when an organization\u2019s growth exceeds expectations, the server capacity it needs to succeed can be in place in minutes rather than weeks.",

Amazon Web Services\u2019 new VM Import feature could be a game changer for hybrid cloud deployments. The product allows IT departments to move virtual machine images from their internal data centers to the cloud, as needed. Many applications can benefit from this neat little trick. The low-hanging fruit is disaster recovery, as well as any migration to the cloud required to bring more capacity online by allocating additional VMs.\r\n\r\nThe process is pretty simple. \u201cTo import images, IT departments use Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) API tools to point to a virtual machine image in their existing environment. Next, they specify the amount of compute capacity they need and where they want to run the image in Amazon\u2019s cloud platform. VM Import will then automatically transfer the image file, migrate the image, and create the instance in Amazon\u2019s cloud,\u201d says Amazon.com.",

All of the red-hot consumer Internet sites now dominating the conversation about the Web are built on a public cloud infrastructure. Facebook, Zynga, Twitter \u2013 they all rely on public clouds from Amazon.com (AMZN) and others to host their data. As Crosby notes, the public cloud is expanding at an astonishing rate: he says the cloud will quarduple in size over the next two years. The phenomenon is driven by a host of factors, not the least of which is the proliferation of of tablets and smart phones dependent on the cloud to store data. And as Crosby says, consumers have largely come to grips with the security and privacy trade-offs that come with the cool apps the cloud enables.",

By contrast, the 145th-fastest machine on the most recent \u201cTop500\u201d list of the fastest supercomputers reached a sustained speed of 41.88 teraflops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe service is sold on the basis of much smaller nodes than what was used in Amazon\u2019s test: a server with two quad-core Intel X5570 Nehalem Xeon processors. Each such instance costs $1.60 per hour to use. Alternatively, with a payment of $4,290 for one year or $6,590 for three years, the per-hour fee drops to 56 cents.",

But the arrival of cloud computing \u2013 which transforms computer processing, data storage, and software applications into utilities served up by central plants \u2013 marks a fundamental change in the economics of computing. It pushes down the price and expands the availability of computing in a way that effectively removes, or at least radically diminishes, capacity constraints on users.\u201d \r\n\r\n\u201cMy favorite example, which is about a year old now, is both simple and revealing. In late 2007, the New York Times faced a challenge.
