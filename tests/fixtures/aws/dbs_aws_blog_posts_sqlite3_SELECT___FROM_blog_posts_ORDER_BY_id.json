One of the main benefits of RDS Proxy is that it can improve application recovery time while efficiently and automatically handling database failovers, which is valid with both planned and unplanned failovers. For more details, see Improving application availability with Amazon RDS Proxy. For common use cases where RDS Proxy is beneficial, refer to Amazon RDS Proxy FAQs.

Customers are building generative AI applications using large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models (FMs), which enhance customer experiences, transform operations, improve employee productivity, and create new revenue channels. The biggest concern we hear from customers as they explore the advantages of generative AI is how to protect their highly sensitive data and investments. At AWS, our top priority is safeguarding the security and confidentiality of our customers\u2019 workloads. We think about security across the three layers of our generative AI stack \u2026",

    "postExcerpt": "Amazon QuickSight is an IAM Identity Center enabled application. Administrators can create a new QuickSight account and use IAM Identity Center for managing QuickSight users and groups. IAM Identity Center can store QuickSight user and group identities within IAM Identity Center itself as an identity store, or they can configure it with a third-party identity provider (IdP) used within their organization. Administrators can use groups in their IdP to assign QuickSight roles (administrator, author, and reader) to users. After they\u2019re successfully authenticated via IdP, users can seamlessly access QuickSight dashboards either from the QuickSight application or as an embedded component within their business applications. Having QuickSight users and groups provisioned in an IdP also helps control authorization to QuickSight resources like dashboards and datasets.In this post, we discuss when you should use which type of instance, the benefits of using IAM Identity Center with QuickSight, how to configure an account instance, and how to use it to access QuickSight.",

As a fully managed service, QuickSight lets you create and publish interactive dashboards that can then be accessed from any device and embedded into your applications, portals, and websites. QuickSight is expanding filter and control functionality. Previously, a filter could be scoped to a single visual, some visuals, all of the visuals for a dataset on a sheet, or all applicable visuals on a sheet. With the launch of cross-sheet filters and controls, authors can now create, delete, and edit filters that apply to multiple sheets. Previously, cross-sheet filters could be created with parameters in over forty clicks. With the expansion in functionality, they can be created in just five clicks, which shows how much this new feature simplifies setting up filters and controls that impact multiple sheets.",
