If, as seems to be the case, many employees will use generative AI applications to assist them and interactively support their work, then a new style of work is emerging. Success for an employee will mean making the most of the AI tools with which they collaborate. We will want to hire employees who are especially good at working interactively with AI (remember how the ability to use word processors and spreadsheet applications were qualifications for a job in the old days?). We will design employee roles to maximize the benefit of collaboration with AI tools. Remote work and the gig economy have already dramatically changed the nature of work; generative AI is another potential disruption on the horizon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/ai-and-collaboration-a-human-angle/\">Read the full blog</a></p>\n",

Should we be changing or rethinking our transformation plans?</p>\n\n<p>The easy answer is no, but there are some subtleties. We transform to increase our agility in the face of change, and we accept that the future will see major changes and disruptions. The sudden attention demanded by AI is just a vindication of that belief. You can even test yourself: can your company respond quickly and effectively to the sudden, disruptive intrusion AI represents? If so, you may be further along in your transformation than you thought. As we&rsquo;ve always said, responding appropriately requires setting up nimble governance processes, an ability to experiment, a culture of innovation, and automation of the good practices, security, and resilience you require.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/transformation-and-ai/\">Read the full blog</a></p>\n",

And the seeds of the answer are there in that framing as well. How generative AI will affect your business depends on how you and your competitors will use it to innovate new business models and derive new competitive advantages. It&rsquo;s not about what the technology itself does&mdash;exciting as that is&mdash;but about how you will combine it with other technologies, your people&rsquo;s skills, your values and competencies, and your distinctive vision.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/what-will-generative-ai-mean-for-your-business/\">Read the full blog</a></p>\n",

These zettabytes of data have created great opportunities to create personalized customer experiences. But data&rsquo;s growth has also led to increased regulatory oversight around the world.

Beyond simply getting from point A to B safely and on time, passengers are now increasingly seeking a frictionless flying experience&mdash;one that can be provided best by airlines that have adopted cloud-based technologies and modernized their data strategies to personalize sales and redefine customer service. In this sense, United Airlines is setting a new bar. This isn&rsquo;t surprising, as United has frequently pushed the competitive edge in a competitive industry: A champion of sustainable aviation fuel, the airline has a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050. And while 50 percent of the company&rsquo;s digital leadership roles are already occupied by women, the airline&rsquo;s flight training academy plans to train 5,000 new pilots by 2030 and has set a goal that half of its pilot training program will consist of women and people of color.</p>\r\n",

In fact, the WHO estimates by 2050, 10% of the world&rsquo;s population will have disabling hearing loss. Digital solutions can play an important role in improving communications accessibility for people with hearing loss. For example, with an automatic speech recognition service, organizations can easily add speech-to-text capabilities to their applications, including the ability to attribute text to different speakers in a conversation. A leading AWS customer in the intelligence community has used speech recognition technology to add live captioning to its video teleconferencing solution.</p>\r\n",

What has become known as Amara&rsquo;s Law, in honor of the late researcher and scientist Roy Amara, is playing out now in many organizations that adopt artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies. AI/ML has capabilities that seemed science fiction not long ago, from autonomous driving to image recognition and advanced robotics, with surely many more on the way. At the same time, even advanced enterprises can struggle to achieve the anticipated return on their AI/ML investments. Although expectations might have been set high, following several guidelines has helped our customers maximize the business value delivered by their AI/ML initiatives.

From nowhere a demand pops up that a particular technology is urgently needed to modernize their company. The problem to solve is fuzzy, and desired outcomes unclear. I recall a skit from a peer at a team event years ago. In it he emulated one of those executives we&rsquo;ve all met who, after leaving a long flight, rushes into the office and declares that &ldquo;technology X,&rdquo; featured in an in-flight magazine, is exactly what our company needs. It was one reason a favorite retort of mine became, &ldquo;Thank you for the solution, now what was the problem?&rdquo; when confronted with this behavior. It&rsquo;s the silver bullet syndrome at its finest: a desire to be cutting edge without fully understanding the underlying problem or complexity.</p>\r\n",

Those gains come in the form of greater capacity utilization, services that can be turned on and off as needed, and the fact that cloud providers like AWS typically use the most state-of-the-art, energy efficient systems and infrastructure. In a further nod to sustainability, an Amazon official said during a February call with analysts that AWS would reduce e-waste by extending the life of the servers powering its cloud systems from four years to five, and networking equipment from five years to six.</p>\r\n",

From the business&rsquo;s perspective, it meant owners and managers spent time and energy dealing with the logistics and infrastructure of their offerings rather than developing better services for customers.

It&rsquo;s tempting for different parts of the business&mdash;when they feel that IT isn&rsquo;t meeting their needs as quickly as they&rsquo;d like&mdash;to find other ways to get things done. The problem is that they might be bypassing important security or availability controls, or creating IT functions that are impossible to maintain. In fact, IT sometimes appears slow because it&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;adding those security controls. And yet &hellip; the presence of shadow IT is often an indicator that business needs aren&rsquo;t being met. When I was CIO of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, our solution was similar to what Nurani describes below, along with dramatically speeding up IT delivery through DevOps and the cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/unshadow-it/\"><strong>Read the blog</strong></a></p>\r\n",

In stark contrast is the breathtaking teamwork, focus, and precise execution we witness during Formula One (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/f1/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 126, 185); outline: 0px; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none;\">F1</a>) pit stops. An F1 fan myself, I will explore the world of F1 in this blog post about digital transformation. Why? Because behind each on-podium champagne shower stands an ultra-high-performing, innovative, agile, and data-led organisation, obsessed with continuous improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">As much as the pit stop draws the attention, it actually isn&rsquo;t the best example of collaboration in F1. In a pit stop, each individual performs a specific task with little interaction and with hardly any need for communication or creativity. The only interdependence is between the finish of one task and the start of the next and at the completion signal that releases the car back into the pit street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">So, let&rsquo;s look beyond the pit stop to what F1 teams can teach us about agility, innovation, and the right culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\"><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/taking-pole-position-in-your-industry-agility-in-formula-one/\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",

What has become known as Amara&rsquo;s Law, in honor of the late researcher and scientist Roy Amara, is playing out now in many organizations that adopt artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies. AI/ML has capabilities that seemed science fiction not long ago, from autonomous driving to image recognition and advanced robotics, with surely many more on the way. At the same time, even advanced enterprises can struggle to achieve the anticipated return on their AI/ML investments. Although expectations might have been set high, following several guidelines has helped our customers maximize the business value delivered by their AI/ML initiatives.

With organisational complexity growth far exceeding business environment complexity, the shell game of moving money around internally can add to the burden. A combination of non-technologists seeing technology as a dark art and rising investments in technology provokes demands for &ldquo;spend transparency.&rdquo; The resulting technology accountability, or cost allocation model, prompts a fundamental question: who should pay for IT? Should those requesting technology work be held financially accountable for their investments to drive the right behaviour, or should the technology team massively simplify its cost allocation by holding costs centrally as many finance and marketing departments do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/who-pays-decomplexifying-technology-charges/\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",

How can executives build a bridge between the business strategy and the technical design decisions so that they aren&rsquo;t distracted but ready to take the helm when needed?

          "description": "<p style=\"text-align:start\">You don&rsquo;t hike up a mountain in a straight line. Rather, gentle slopes and switchbacks allow you to make a gradual ascent. Even though you aren&rsquo;t heading straight for your goal, you keep an eye on the top of the mountain and track your progress by the changing scenery or elevation. If you haven&rsquo;t encountered a switchback turn in a while, you might look at a map to make sure you didn&rsquo;t take a wrong turn. Small dips, while seemingly taking you away from your goal, are a given and something you need to account for: you&rsquo;ll climb more than the total elevation gain. Occasionally, you need to take a detour&mdash;maybe you need to avoid a blockage or washed-out trail&mdash;but you make sure that you&rsquo;ll merge back onto the main path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Executing a strategy is a quite similar exercise.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/thinking-strategy-add-dimensions/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 126, 185); outline: 0px; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none;\">As shared in my previous post</a>, choosing a goal is comparatively easy.

That was fortuitous for Dave Evans, an engineer who founded <a href=\"https://www.fictiv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fictiv</a> in 2013 after becoming frustrated by the long hours he spent sourcing and managing vendors while leading new product development at Ford. His answer was to create a Digital Manufacturing Ecosystem that can deliver parts 5X faster than traditional sourcing options and shift production from one location to another on a dime. Dave recently spoke on the AWS Industrial Insights podcast about how that agility benefited Fictiv&rsquo;s customers amid the factory shutdowns and product shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/customers/creating-supply-chain-resilience-by-building-a-digital-ecosystem/\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",

At AWS, we&rsquo;ve identified a few ways that organizations can go wrong when setting up a CCOE. In this blog post, N&eacute;stor G&aacute;ndara and Eric Lin, Senior Partner Solutions Architects at AWS, show how to avoid those pitfalls and achieve the full potential of a CCOE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/7-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-building-a-ccoe/\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",

One in eight U.S. couples is infertile, which amounts to 6.5 million Americans of reproductive age. Of those, 2.2 million people are actively trying to get pregnant. Some seek fertility help from their family doctor or OB-GYN and others make appointments at fertility clinics. About 800K will get pregnant. That still leaves 1.4 million people who could benefit from treatment but, in reality, only about 150K access it.

I wrote this as a technology practitioner but a student of ML. At the other end of the experience continuum, I have the privilege of working with some of the world&rsquo;s leading experts in these topics. On a course in 2019, proud of everything I&rsquo;d accomplished during my career, I was humbled to sit between two new Amazon Web Services VPs, one tasked with launching thousands of low-Earth orbit satellites, the other tasked with establishing the Amazon Machine Learning Solutions Lab. The latter, Michelle Lee, has become a regular fixture at AWS advisory councils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this two-part blog post, Michelle and I discuss her insights about adopting ML in businesses. In this first part we talk about the impact of ML on society and businesses in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/interview-with-michelle-lee-vp-of-amazon-machine-learning-solutions-labs-ml-in-society/\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",

It&rsquo;s the current state of IT, the &ldquo;balance sheet,&rdquo; so to speak, that determines what spending and investments are necessary when considered alongside the company&rsquo;s strategic imperatives. A conversation between the CIO and CFO about reducing technical debt can&rsquo;t happen before a conversation about what technical debt exists, what impact it&rsquo;s having or will have on the company, which technical debt is the highest priority to erase, and so on.

To paraphrase Roy Amara, we overestimate the impact of a new technology early on. When it falls short of our expectations, our disappointment means we are less willing to adopt it when it is truly ready. The reality is that often it is only when we change how we operate and organise that many new technologies come into their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/making-artificial-intelligence-real/\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",

The term&nbsp;<em>technical debt</em>, attributed to Ward Cunningham in a 1992 OOPSLA conference speech&sup1;, may be an example. We use the term often these days, generally in the context of justifying investments in nonfunctional aspects of IT; that is, investments intended to improve the internals of IT systems, rather than to add new user-facing IT capabilities. Such nonfunctional investments, unsurprisingly, can be difficult to explain and justify. The term&nbsp;<em>technical debt</em>&nbsp;has seemed like a good way to communicate this need &ldquo;in the language of the business.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/the-cio-cfo-conversation-technical-debt-an-apt-term/\">Read more &raquo;</a></strong></p>\r\n",

More recently, they are also using services like AWS PrivateLink to connect and transfer data both within their own organization and with other organizations with a presence in the AWS Cloud. AWS PrivateLink uses AWS&rsquo;s internal network connectivity instead of the public internet to ensure secure connectivity (think of it like a virtual cross connect). Not only are financial data providers such as Bloomberg leveraging AWS PrivateLink to distribute real-time market data to its customers, but financial regulators such as FINRA are also leveraging AWS PrivateLink as a connectivity option for broker-dealers to securely send their order and transaction data to comply with the CAT reporting regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/guest-blog-the-consolidated-audit-trail-and-the-cloud/\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",

However, I feel there&rsquo;s a gap in understanding how critical data is to the success and effectiveness of machine learning. There seems to be a focus on using data to create data products or surface actionable business insights. The reality, though, is that machine learning doesn&rsquo;t exist without data. And, if your sample size is too small or the quality of your data misrepresents reality, your machine learning models will be useless. In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll explore training models and go over some examples of how data and data quality can impact machine learning models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/machine-learning-avoiding-garbage-in-garbage-out/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",

I was a customer for 26 years in my various roles at The Coca-Cola Company and benefited from Amazon&rsquo;s customer obsession. What I found is this often comes down to creating, and constantly making better, great customer experiences. Cloud technology can massively shorten the time it takes to deliver innovative experiences with lower total costs, and AWS customers like GoDaddy and Anthem are doing this on a daily basis. Even so, delivering great experiences isn&rsquo;t always easy&mdash;it requires balancing business priorities, creating internal mechanisms to inspire experimentation, and teams that embrace diverse thinking.

The bigger the business, the bigger the challenge for leaders to set and execute a common strategy. This is especially true when looking to reap the benefits of moving to Cloud. When you suddenly remove a huge amount of undifferentiated heavy lifting, pay attention to being customer-obsessed, and focus on the data and logic required of technology to deliver this end, some people are going to feel intimidated at best and hostile at worst for what this means to them personally. This FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) can be magnified in the move to Cloud, because it cuts across so many paradigms and existing job roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/creating-the-cloud-business-office/\"><strong>Read more &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n",
