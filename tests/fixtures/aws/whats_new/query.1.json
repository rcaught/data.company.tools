    "postSummary": "<p>Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights launches cross-account observability across Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to help you monitor and troubleshoot applications that span across multiple AWS accounts within an AWS Region. Central Operational Teams managing container administration can now monitor and analyze container health and performance across their organization from a consolidated view and maintain the overall application health status to achieve the best business results.</p>\r\n",
    "postBody": "<p>Using cross-account observability in Container Insights for EKS, you do not need to switch accounts when you are troubleshooting, which saves you time and effort. With cross-account observability you can now filter your containers operating at high utilization by account ids or account labels and identify which teams require rightsizing in their resources. Cross-account observability enables you to drill down into an alarm on your containers regardless of the account owning the resource and identify the root-cause without account boundaries, reducing your mean time to resolution.</p>\r\n<p>Once you enable cross account observability for CloudWatch, it works with Container Insights for EKS out-of-the-box. After you complete the set up, you can use your monitoring accounts to access organization-wide container observability in Container Insights for EKS.</p>\r\n<p>Cross-account observability in Container Insights for EKS is now available in <a href=\"/content/aws.amazon.com/live/en_US/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all public AWS Regions</a>, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China (Beijing, operated by Sinnet), and China (Ningxia, operated by NWCD).

This integration enables administrators to leverage IAM security features such as audit logging and multi-factor authentication.

The IAM identity used to create a EKS cluster can have its Kubernetes permissions removed or scoped down to comply with security requirements, and control of a cluster can always be restored to an AWS account administrator. Other AWS services can use EKS access management controls to automatically obtain permissions to run applications on EKS clusters.
