There seems to be a focus on using data to create data products or surface actionable business insights. The reality, though, is that machine learning doesn&rsquo;t exist without data. And, if your sample size is too small or the quality of your data misrepresents reality, your machine learning models will be useless.

Even though you aren&rsquo;t heading straight for your goal, you keep an eye on the top of the mountain and track your progress by the changing scenery or elevation. If you haven&rsquo;t encountered a switchback turn in a while, you might look at a map to make sure you didn&rsquo;t take a wrong turn. Small dips, while seemingly taking you away from your goal, are a given and something you need to account for: you&rsquo;ll climb more than the total elevation gain. Occasionally, you need to take a detour&mdash;maybe you need to avoid a blockage or washed-out trail&mdash;but you make sure that you&rsquo;ll merge back onto the main path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Executing a strategy is a quite similar exercise.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/thinking-strategy-add-dimensions/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 126, 185); outline: 0px; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none;\">As shared in my previous post</a>, choosing a goal is comparatively easy.

    "description": "<p>Amazon Web Services customers have many services to contemplate, and perhaps integrate into their cloud footprint, irrespective of where they are in their cloud journey. The relentless pace of innovation continues to be one of the main attractions for customers with AWS as their cloud provider; knowing that new services and features are always coming, customers feel confident that many (if not all) of their organization&rsquo;s needs can be fulfilled by one or more AWS products. Customer CISOs (or their respective teams) may want to take the time to ensure that they are well versed with all AWS services because there may be a security, risk, or compliance objective that can be met, even if a service doesn&rsquo;t fall into the &ldquo;Security, Identity, and Compliance&rdquo; category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/ciso-insight-every-aws-service-is-a-security-service/\">Read more &raquo;</a></strong></p>\r\n",

Those gains come in the form of greater capacity utilization, services that can be turned on and off as needed, and the fact that cloud providers like AWS typically use the most state-of-the-art, energy efficient systems and infrastructure.

The sudden attention demanded by AI is just a vindication of that belief. You can even test yourself: can your company respond quickly and effectively to the sudden, disruptive intrusion AI represents? If so, you may be further along in your transformation than you thought. As we&rsquo;ve always said, responding appropriately requires setting up nimble governance processes, an ability to experiment, a culture of innovation, and automation of the good practices, security, and resilience you require.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/transformation-and-ai/\">Read the full blog</a></p>\n",
