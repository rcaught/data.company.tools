And that&rsquo;s to say nothing of Haven, the joint venture it formed with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to improve care and lower costs for the companies&rsquo; employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon&rsquo;s health executives mostly work in secret, but in recent months the fruits of their labor have begun filtering through the marketplace. Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, launched a product called Amazon Comprehend Medical that uses machine learning to extract key data from electronic health records; the company&rsquo;s cloud-based analytics are gaining wider adoption by hospitals and drug makers; and the Alexa voice assistant can now be used to build HIPAA-compliant voice tools.</p>\r\n",

Carlson&rsquo;s community involvement includes serving on the boards of the Northern Virginia Technology Council and the Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p>Speech recognition technologies have improved so much in recent years &ndash; thanks to cloud computing and advances in machine learning &ndash; that the virtual assistants created by Amazon, Google and Apple have quickly become popular with consumers. During a keynote presentation at Enterprise Connect, Dave Ibitski, Amazon chief evangelist for Echo and Alexa, said that voice interfaces would be the &ldquo;next major disruption in computing,&rdquo; with clear applications with business settings. &ldquo;It is that idea of ambient computing, the idea that at any time I could just say &lsquo;Alexa start my meeting,&rsquo; &lsquo;Alexa how are my sales figures?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Alexa I forgot to shut off the projector in the conference room please shut that off for me.&rsquo; &ldquo;It is very natural, it is very spontaneous,&rdquo; Ibitski said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collin Davis, general manager of Alexa for Business, said virtual assistants are already helping employees get work done. &ldquo;What we are finding is a really interesting shift is happening, where voice is offering up almost another dimension of multi-tasking, where workers sitting at their desk can use Alexa almost as a vocal multi-tasker to be able to get information quickly without losing focus,&rdquo; Davis said. &ldquo;You could be working on a report and you need to know how many deals closed last quarter without having to reach into your pocket or find an app or switch websites &ndash; you just get the information that you need. &quot;There are now more than 30,000 Alexa skills, and Davis said that a &ldquo;growing community&rdquo; of skill developers are focused on building skills for the workplace, and software vendors are voice-enabling existing applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

But Ms. Pardo, a 62-year-old industrial designer, has taken an easier route. She uses a new invention called the Airnoise Button that allows her to register a complaint simply by pressing it. The Airnoise Button was created last year by Chris McCann, a 51-year-old former U.S. Air Force test pilot and computer programmer in La Jolla, Calif. Mr. McCann developed software that he linked to an Amazon product called the AWS IoT Button (or Amazon Web Services Internet-of-Things Button), which is programmable for a variety of uses.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p>Voice interactions with AI assistants are fast becoming commonplace at home. With Alexa for Business, Amazon hopes to make the same true in the office. &ldquo;Just like Alexa is making smart home experiences easier, the same is possible in the workplace with voice controls,&rdquo; said Collin Davies, Amazon&rsquo;s general manager for Alexa for Business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon&rsquo;s aim is to make it easier for businesses to deploy and operate Alexa in the workplace. Configuring and operating devices across an organization presents a different and more complex challenge than setting up multiple devices in the home, said Davis. &ldquo;While the Alexa mobile application works great for configuring at-home or personal use, there&#39;s so much more that an enterprise needs,&rdquo; said Davis.</p>\r\n",

The online retail giant said Wednesday that developers can now apply to test the voices, which were built to sound like U.S. English speakers. The point of having access to multiple Alexa voices is so developers can build skills (apps) in which users interact with a variety of voices instead of just one. For instance, if coders were to create interactive audio stories for Alexa, they could use the new voices to represent different characters, Amazon said. The new Alexa voices are part of the company&rsquo;s Polly service, which developers use to build skills (apps) for Alexa that can recognize text and convert it to a voice that can beam out of an Alexa-powered device like the Amazon Echo smart speaker. Amazon said that developers who are accepted to test the voices will be able to use them for free, but that will likely change when the voices are available to the general public to be used outside of a preview.</p>\r\n",

But in a rare interview during a health conference, one of its senior leaders hinted at some areas of focus for the e-commerce giant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taha Kass-Hout, the former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief health informatics officer who joined Amazon in March, didn&rsquo;t reveal any trade secrets in the interview with the health website Stat, but indicated that Amazon sees big potential in developing AI tools for health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;AI is medicine is not a new concept,&rdquo; Kass-Hout said, explaining that the earliest uses of the technology in health dates to the 1960s when it was first used to navigate patients to the right place. He noted that the past year has seen a massive uptick in research papers that use &ldquo;prediction and natural language understanding&rdquo; in a variety of new ways.</p>\r\n",

Instead of clunky handheld scanners, that often get in the way as workers grapple with bigger items, AI cameras and scanners watch the process and automatically track which products go into which bins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might seem like a small change, but it has had a significant impact on efficiency, said Brad Porter, Amazon&rsquo;s vice-president of robotics, at the company&rsquo;s re:MARS artificial intelligence and robotics conference in June.

Now, developers can configure auto scaling across a set of AWS services in a single unified interface. Companies typically use multiple AWS services to build their applications, and up until now that required some work to make sure the various pieces were scaling as the application required it.

The key to Sumerian&rsquo;s developer appeal, Amazon notes, is that it &ldquo;does not require any specialized programming or 3D graphics expertise,&rdquo; using a web-based editor to create scenes, and a visual scripting tool to chart how characters and objects will respond to users. Developers can also draw upon Amazon&rsquo;s Lex, Polly, AWS Lambda, AWS IoT, and Amazon DynamoDB services to power user-character interactions.</p>\r\n",

Amazon says it will work with LaGuardia Community College (LAGCC), the City University of New York (CUNY), and the State University of New York (SUNY) to create a cloud computing certificate program for students across New York. The goal will be to get students ready for entry-level tech roles &ndash; like those at Amazon or elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program, which begins this fall, will be offered to the tens of thousands of students across these universities, Amazon says. In addition, LAGCC will partner with at least one New York City high school to offer concurrent enrollment in the 15-credit certificate program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the new high school courses are being funded through the Amazon Future Engineer program, this certificate program for college students is being handled through Amazon&rsquo;s AWS Educate program. The Educate program is today being used by over 1,500 institutions to train students in cloud computing by offering them hands-on experience in AWS technology. This skill can then be used to apply for jobs at Amazon and other companies.</p>\r\n",

The company uses novel techniques to keep the needed amount of computing power locked down while providing similar performance.

While other algorithms can see exponential increases in the amount of time and processing power needed, Amazon&rsquo;s algorithms don&rsquo;t. As data is streamed into the system, the algorithm adjusts its state &mdash; a persistent representation of the statistical patterns present in the information fed into SageMaker for training a particular system.</p>\r\n",

Jassy noted that lessons learned from the Fire Phone project were incorporated into other Amazon devices.</p>\r\n",

Toward that end, it today launched AWS Deep Learning Containers, a library of Docker images preinstalled with popular deep learning frameworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done all the hard work of building, compiling, and generating, configuring, optimizing all of these frameworks, so you don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Dr. Matt Wood, general manager of deep learning and AI at AWS, said onstage at the AWS Summit in Santa Clara this morning. &ldquo;And that means that you do less of the undifferentiated heavy lifting of installing these very, very complicated frameworks and then maintaining them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new AWS container images in question &mdash; which are preconfigured and validated by Amazon &mdash; support Google&rsquo;s TensorFlow machine learning framework and Apache MXNet, with Facebook&rsquo;s PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks to come. And they work on the full range of AWS services including Amazon ECS, Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and with Kubernetes on Amazon EC2.

AWS PrivateLink, a networking technology, is aimed at facilitating access to AWS services in a highly scalable and available way, while still keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network. So, when users develop AWS PrivateLink endpoints for ECR and ECS, these service endpoints will appear as elastic network interfaces with a private IP address in their VPC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before AWS PrivateLink, Amazon EC2 instances had to route traffic via the public internet to download Docker images stored in ECR or communicate to the ECS control plane. But with the addition of AWS PrivateLink support, instances in both private as well as public subnets can use it to attain private connectivity to download images from Amazon ECR, thus bypassing the public internet. Furthermore, with AWS PrivateLink, traffic doesn&rsquo;t traverse the Internet; this helps minimize the exposure to threats like distributed denial-of-service and brute force attacks.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p>Whereas its fellow tech titans flaunt their AI prowess at every opportunity&mdash;Facebook&rsquo;s facial-recognition software, Apple&rsquo;s Siri digital assistant or Alphabet&rsquo;s self-driving cars and master go player&mdash;Amazon has adopted a lower-key approach to machine learning. Yes, its Alexa competes with Siri and the company offers predictive services in its cloud. But the algorithms most critical to the company&rsquo;s success are those it uses to constantly streamline its own operations. The feedback loop looks the same as in its consumer-facing AI: build a service, attract customers, gather data, and let computers learn from these data, all at a scale that human labour could not emulate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AWS&rsquo;s chief use of machine learning is to forecast demand for computation. Insufficient computing power as internet users flock to a customer&rsquo;s service can engender errors&mdash;and lost sales as users encounter error pages. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re out of stock,&rdquo; says Andy Jassy, AWS&rsquo;s boss. To ensure they never have to, Mr Jassy&rsquo;s team crunches customer data. Amazon cannot see what is hosted on its servers, but it can monitor how much traffic each of its customers gets, how long the connections last and how solid they are. As in its fulfilment centres, these metadata feed machine-learning models which predict when and where AWS is going to see demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of AWS&rsquo;s biggest customers is Amazon itself. And one of the main things other Amazon businesses want is predictions. Demand is so high that AWS has designed a new chip, called Inferentia, to handle these tasks. Mr Jassy says that Inferentia will save Amazon money on all the machine-learning tasks it needs to run in order to keep the lights on, as well as attracting customers to its cloud services. &ldquo;We believe it can be at least an order-of-magnitude improvement in cost and efficiency,&rdquo; he says. The algorithms which recognise voices and understand human language in Alexa will be one big beneficiary.</p>\r\n",

It also allows developers who lack hardcore data science skills to experiment with machine-learning models in their applications, and both groups will be able to run those models on almost all of the instance types offered by AWS. AWS is also open-sourcing the containers it built for two popular machine-learning frameworks, MXNet and Tensorflow. This will allow developers to customize those containers to better suit their own models and run them on local machines, rather than spending a bunch of money tweaking those models on the cloud.</p>\r\n",

Sales grew 49% from the year-ago quarter to $6.11 billion, and operating profit grew too, to $1.64 billion, up from $916 million. AWS got to brag about other important successes. For instance, AWS reminded everyone that it does have customers in the retail industry and that it just landed Zulily this quarter (a deal announced in June). Zulily is a Seattle based ecommerce site best known for its deals on women&#39;s and kids clothes. This deal is Amazon&#39;s way of saying that not every retailer is shunning it. Other retailers won&#39;t use AWS because parent company Amazon is a threat to them. Beyond a new retail customer, Amazon also noted that it scored two more companies that are ditching their own data centers to go &quot;all-in&quot; on AWS, Irish airline Ryanair and video game company Epic Games, the maker of the wildly popular Fortnite game.</p>\r\n",

AWS now offers six managed and generally available databases on its cloud service as well as a database migration service for moving hosted databases into the cloud. Graph databases are designed for applications that need to quickly make sense of the associations between different groups of data. They allow users to store related bits of data as a graph that can be accessed in a single operation, rather than a bunch of individual queries for all that data. Companies building social networks, fraud-detection apps or personalization features for existing apps, for example, can take advantage of graph databases to deliver more flexibility and speed.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p>Most Amazon customers have likely never heard of its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), but they probably use it more than its retail arm. With thousands of staff &mdash; the company will not say how many &mdash; from Seattle to Cape Town to Delhi, AWS powers many household-name businesses, from Expedia to Vodafone to Netflix. The latter alone accounts for more than a third of US internet traffic, according to some reports. AWS rolled out 1,430 new services in 2017, many of them aimed at tech start-ups. In cloud computing and despite an aggressive pricing policy, AWS has taken on what founder and chief executive Andy Jassy has called &ldquo;old guard&rdquo; tech companies, such as Microsoft and IBM.</p>\r\n",

That&rsquo;s left Amazon with something to prove.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going as far back as 25 years, Amazon has been &ldquo;truly pioneering the way we apply machine learning to real world problems,&rdquo; AWS CTO Werner Vogels claimed Thursday on at the re:MARS conference in Las Vegas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its new re:MARS conference, Amazon is aiming to change the narrative around AI. It laid out the way AI is integrated into every part of its massive e-commerce business. It announced a new, cutting-edge drone designs and pushed forward Alexa&rsquo;s conversational speech capabilities. Amazon also dazzled conference attendees with appearances from tech luminaries like Andrew Ng and celebrities like Robert Downey, Jr. All told, the week served to sell Amazon to its potential partners and customers as an innovator and a leader in AI -- and a company that can help others gain their own AI-powered advantages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The mega-telecom launched a new service using what it calls the AT&amp;T LTE-M Button, which offers a one-click connection via smartphone app to AT&amp;T&rsquo;s nationwide LTE-M network. This is a physical device to carry in your pocket. This technology enables internet of things devices to connect directly to a 4G network without a gateway and on batteries. LTE is the generic term for 4G networks.

One of the most popular features is using Alexa to control conference room equipment and start meetings. As an extension of that, Amazon announced on Tuesday a new room booking feature for Alexa for Business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alexa for Business could already find open meeting rooms, but now users can ask specifically about the room in which they&#39;re standing. The feature, Amazon says, addresses the common challenge of walking from room to room to find an open space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The feature is enabled once a user links their calendar provider with read/write permissions. Then, they can ask, &quot;Alexa, is this room free?&quot; to check the room&#39;s availability. If it&#39;s free, they can use Alexa to book it for a certain period of time. If not, they can ask, &quot;Alexa, who booked this room?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, Amazon is soon releasing in beta a Room Booking API so that customers can use voice to interact with their existing room booking tools.</p>\r\n",

This competition, held in conjunction with the AWS Summit at the Palais des Congr&egrave;s, brought together developers from all over the world who came to compete in a race of 1/18th scale self-driving cars. And Capgemini finished at the top of the podium with 1st and 3rd place. Two students, Arthur Pace (UTT) and Matthieu Rousseau (ISEP), interns at Capgemini AIE (Application Innovation Exchange) directed by Jean-Claude Guyard, developed the miracle algorithm. The two winners will participate in the Las Vegas world final in November 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its competition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provided participants with a dedicated service on AWS Sagemaker to develop their own artificial intelligence, based on reinforcement learning. The concept: a neural network predicts one of the multiple possible movements of the car (accelerate, slow down, turn left, etc.) followed by a reward function that evaluates the error made by the car at each iteration (Is the car in the middle of the track? Is it moving fast? etc.). Progressively as attempts are made, the car learns to move between the two white lines. Capgemini AEI is currently working on innovation projects around disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, robotics, augmented and virtual reality, 3D printing, etc.).</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p>The biggest announcement out of the whole show was that the new Amazon.com Relational Database Service (or Amazon RDS, for short) would run on and be supported by VMware. This is a huge deal which should simplify the deployment, operations, and scaling of databases in VMware-based datacenters, making it easier to migrate them to either AWS or VMware Cloud on AWS. The crux of Amazon RDS is that it automates database management wherever the database is deployed, which could save customers significant time and trouble. This new service will support a variety of leading databases, including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB. During the General Session, VMware gave a demonstration of how Amazon RDS runs on VMware in a private datacenter. VMware says that this essentially gives developers &ldquo;a familiar RDS functionality&rdquo; on VMware, in both private datacenters and Edge environments. Now we have AWS Greengrass and now RDS to run on-prem. And we thought AWS just operated in their own cloud. Surprise! This should give every company in the on-prem space a moment of pause.</p>\r\n",

In this article, InformationWeek provides a detailed recap on AWS&rsquo;s Q3 earnings announcements and their broader industry implications. Charles Babcock writes, &ldquo;Amazon is where it is mostly because it keeps using cloud technologies to hand off more power to the customer. Its goal now is to hand off increasingly sophisticated services that end-users can self-provision and self-manage. Its call for database migrations to the cloud is just the start.

    "description": "<p>Interoperability in healthcare isn&rsquo;t just a buzzword for the healthcare community, it&rsquo;s also something technology companies are talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick Combes, technology leader for healthcare and life sciences at Amazon Web Services (AWS), said interoperability in healthcare is one of the biggest trends he&rsquo;s paying attention to this year. While AWS is a major provider of cloud computing services, its healthcare and life sciences track focuses specifically on simplifying technology integration for healthcare organizations, where improving care delivery to patients is part of its underlying mission statement for healthcare providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview with Combes at HIMSS 2019, he said he&rsquo;s seen a push toward greater interoperability both from federal regulators and demand from AWS customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;People are beginning to realize the value of bringing this data together,&rdquo; he said, citing this as the reason for the uptick in interoperability interest.</p>\r\n",

Sure, there is a hiccup here and there, but if Amazon had executed as well in its online retailing business as it has in the public cloud, half the strip malls in America would be dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an annualized run rate of over $30 billion, AWS has become one of the dominant platform peddlers not only here in the 21st century, but since the advent of data processing on electronic devices in datacenters five or six decades ago, depending on where you want to draw the lines. No single Unix platform was ever as big as Amazon, and even IBM&rsquo;s system business, viewed in the totality of its System z mainframes and Power Systems server lines and the systems software and support and financial services that are wrapped up with them, is now smaller than the AWS cloud.</p>\r\n",

The infrastructure-as-a-service giant today announced the general availability of AWS IoT Analytics, a service for processing the data generated by devices in the &ldquo;internet of things.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s specifically designed to address the great deal of variety that exists in how different&nbsp;firms&nbsp;are applying their machine-generated information. IoT Analytics can ingest transmissions from a range of connected devices, including soil sensors and industrial equipment, and then ready the data for processing. The service lets companies customize various aspects of the preparation process, such as what readings to filter, based on their needs. Users can then employ the built-in analysis tools to start looking for patterns.</p>\r\n",

Nothing is stored or cached on the phone and AWS says WorkLink knows nothing about personal device activity either.

With the instances, AWS offers more computing power for less money, and the ARM architecture gets a big boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">In December, AWS unveiled Graviton 2. This is an in-house built server cpu based on the Arm Neoverse design. The 7nm chip provides 64 computing cores with 32MB of L3 cache per core. AWS introduced the processor as a preview in its m6, c6 and r6 instances and promised up to seven times the performance of Graviton&#39;s first generation. Today, the M6g instances are launched to an audience.</p>\r\n",

At the same time, Dai Nippon Printing (DNP), which uses the service, explained the company&rsquo;s efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the elements that enables DeepRacer&rsquo; self-driving is reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning. In this method, the machine learns by being given a high reward function when it performs an ideal action. For example, if the position of the car is within 10% of the center line; 1.0 points are given, and if it is within 25%, 0.5 points are given. The location of the center line is recognized with images taken by the onboard camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;AWS has invested in machine learning for 20 years,&rdquo; said Yoichi Takizawa, Senior Manager, Principal Solutions Architect of AWS Japan. &ldquo;We developed this service because we wanted to bring reinforcement learning to all developers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p>After announcing that they were launching a managed blockchain service late last year, Amazon Web Services is now opening that service for general availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was only about five months ago that AWS chief executive Andy Jassy announced that the company was reversing course on its previous dismissal of blockchain technologies and laid out a new service it would develop on top of open-source frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Customers want to use blockchain frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum to create blockchain networks so they can conduct business quickly, with an immutable record of transactions, but without the need for a centralized authority. However, they find these frameworks difficult to install, configure, and manage,&rdquo; said Rahul Pathak, general manager, Amazon Managed Blockchain at AWS, in a statement. &ldquo;Amazon Managed Blockchain takes care of provisioning nodes, setting up the network, managing certificates and security, and scaling the network. Customers can now get a functioning blockchain network set up quickly and easily, so they can focus on application development instead of keeping a blockchain network up and running.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

Four years after introducing the T2 instance type, Amazon Web Services Tuesday brought online the T3s, providing customers with volatile workloads greater savings potential. The T3s, available to provision in 12 AWS regions around the world, &ldquo;are even more cost-effective than the T2 instances,&rdquo; AWS chief evangelist Jeff Barr said in a blog post. The newest EC2 virtual machines improve on their predecessors in price performance by 30 percent, according to Seattle-based AWS. The T-series makes possible cost savings for workloads that typically don&rsquo;t approach the maximum performance of their CPUs, but do require periodic bursts of computing power. AWS delivers the baseline percentage of processing power, and customers accumulate credits when idle that can be consumed later. Those credits are stored for up to seven days.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p>We&rsquo;re a few years into an unprecedented push for federal IT modernization. Has meaningful progress been made?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AWS works with just about every agency of the federal government and we&rsquo;re seeing meaningful progress in IT modernization happening throughout. It&rsquo;s been about a decade since the 25-point plan and the cloud-first strategy came out, and in the early days what we were seeing was agencies were doing individual&nbsp;workloads, and they were taking some fairly low-risk things and they were moving it into the cloud. Today what we&rsquo;re seeing is widespread adoption. From those early successes they realized the benefits of moving to the cloud. Now we&rsquo;re seeing many mission-critical applications moving to the cloud. For example, just last week Defense Health Agency announced that they moved a critical system, an Impact Level 4 FISMA moderate system, that&rsquo;s really important so that the military families can get their healthcare paid for. And now what we&rsquo;re seeing is not only that these things are happening but now agencies are taking advantage of some of these new technologies. So for example, DHS Citizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, they&rsquo;ve moved into a DevOps agile mode, and what&rsquo;s happening today is they&rsquo;re constantly iterating. It&rsquo;s my hope that sometime in the future we no longer even have to have an IT Modernization conference, because modernization will be a critical part or an integral part of operation maintenance moving forward.</p>\r\n",

That was the case with the county&rsquo;s existing call center, which had existed on-prem for more than a decade, said Benny Chacko, deputy general manager of the Internal Services Department (ISD). A contact center, Chacko added, could enable &ldquo;multiple modes of contact&rdquo; including text, mobile and online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was more of an opportunity to really leverage that type of newer technology as it relates to cloud-based contact centers, see how can we really get rid of those standard types of calls or those types of actions that our agents would typically have to take or receive those calls. And have those handled through some kind of automated fashion through artificial intelligence (AI),&rdquo; Chacko said. The agency partnered with Presidio and Amazon Web Services in late 2018 to deploy the latter&rsquo;s AWS Connect; and, though the rollout is ongoing, it is already seeing benefits in how AI and machine learning can streamline communication.</p>\r\n",

Users&#39; object storage data is kept in virtual repositories called S3 buckets. These are physically stored in AWS data centres in a small geographic area called an Availability Zone.These zones are grouped into larger geographic areas called Regions &ndash; storing copies of data across availability zones decreases the risk of data loss, and storing copies across regions decreases the loss risk further. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/\" target=\"_blank\">According to Amazon</a>, S3 Z-IA stored data is held in one availability zone, whereas S-IA and S3 Standard data is housed across three. AWS S3 standard and S3 S-IA promises 99.99 and 99.9 per cent availability per given year, respectively, and S3 Z-IA includes 99.5 per cent availability per given year.

    "description": "<div>Oganizations can move large amounts of data to AWS via either a network connection or transportable drives. Because of the large quantities involved when an enterprise aggregates data, a Direct Connect high-speed, private link is the best network connection option, as speeds can reach up to 10 Gbps. Even when you use multi-gigabit network pipes, it takes time to replicate terabytes of data. For example, 20 TBs of data requires more than 51 hours to copy over a 1 Gbps link. AWS acknowledged the roadblock this presents to organizations with huge data footprints. Subsequently, the cloud provider unveiled <a href=\"http://searchaws.techtarget.com/definition/AWS-Import-Export-Snowball\">Snowball</a>, a portable, ruggedized hard drive and associated software, to simplify batch transfers of multi-terabyte data sets. Snowball, which comes in 50 TB and 80 TB sizes, includes a 10GBase-T network-attached storage connection, and its software enables you to use multiple devices in parallel to <a href=\"http://searchaws.techtarget.com/tip/Snowball-appliance-just-one-option-for-moving-data-to-AWS\">simplify the transfer</a> of 100-plus TB data sets.

Services like S3 (Simple Storage Service) and EC2 (Elastic Computing Cloud) power a ton of websites.\r\n\r\nSimple Email Service works pretty much the same way as the rest of the Amazon infrastructure: use a simple API, pay only for what you use (in this case, how much email you send), grow as you scale. And like most of the rest of the Amazon services, the rates are really, really cheap: only ten cents per thousand emails sent. That's maybe 20% the cost of similar existing services.",

That business lets companies buy from Amazon, on an hourly basis, computing power that\u2019s delivered over the Internet. The Singapore data center will target Asian customers and Western companies that have many users in the region.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBeyond small startups, Amazon counts larger organizations including Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE), NASA, Adobe Systems (ADBE), and Netflix (NFLX) as cloud computing customers. On Mar. 23, it released a software development kit so Java developers could more easily write applications that take advantage of its computing services. An Apr. 15 deal with NetSuite (N) lets customers of the online accounting software firm store their data on Amazon\u2019s computers.\u201d",

Although he won't cite exact numbers, Jassy claims \"hundreds of thousands of customers\" already use the service, and analysts at UBS (UBS) estimate Amazon will do about $750 million of business on AWS this year. In fact, a whole generation of Internet companies couldn't exist without it. Netflix's (NFLX) movie-streaming empire runs on it; Zynga, the social gaming company, uses it to handle sudden spikes in usage. AWS has become such a fact of life for Silicon Valley startups that venture capitalists actually hand out Amazon gift cards to entrepreneurs. Keeping up with the demand requires frantic expansion: Each day, Jassy's operation adds enough computing muscle to power one whole Amazon.com circa 2000, when it was a $2.8 billion business.\u201d",

    "description": "<p>Everyone&#39;s &quot;going to the cloud&quot; these days, but few are likely getting the full benefits from the move. &quot;What you need to really take advantage of cloud computing is a complete rethink of your approach to IT,&quot; declared Capital One Vice President of Cloud Strategy Bernard Golden. Not, as many (most?) do, &quot;treat[ing] cloud computing like a data center at the end of the wire.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cloud requires a different mentality, a different culture. Cultural change is hard, which is probably the biggest reason we&#39;re seeing AWS step back from it&#39;s &quot;if it&#39;s not public it&#39;s not cloud&quot; stance to give enterprises a more gradual path to cloud nirvana. Even so, the companies that win biggest in cloud will be those that change fastest, as Golden and I discussed in an interview following AWS re:Invent.</p>\r\n",

In India too, a few companies are transitioning to a new age where cloud computing&mdash;on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing&mdash;is enabling them to transform into intelligent enterprises. India is set to be among the top cloud markets in the world by 2020, with $4.1 billion market opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the case of water purifier brand, Kent RO Systems. As part of its support infrastructure, Kent has a call centre with more than 100 agents responding to people&rsquo;s enquiries. Kent&rsquo;s customer relationship management (CRM) environment ran on the cloud. Saurabh Gupta, chief information officer at Kent, however, wanted to give the environment a more &ldquo;flexible footing&rdquo;. Kent chose Amazon Web Services (AWS) after a review of cloud-service providers. Kent now has more agility with its CRM solution because of AWS. The company can scale up the CRM environment on demand and, likewise, scale down if necessary. It also avoids IT-procurement cycles and time-consuming deployment projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have lowered our IT infrastructure and cloud services costs by 10% by switching to the AWS Cloud. By using AWS Device Farm, our DevOps team is developing apps more efficiently,&rdquo; Gupta says.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Article Excerpt:\r\nA new option for Amazon Web Services has arrived: the raw computing power of supercomputing clusters now widely used in research circles.\r\nThe service, called Cluster Compute, is a variation of one of the earliest services Amazon offered, EC2, or Elastic Compute Cloud. Compared with the standard EC2, Cluster Compute offers more processing power and faster network connections among the cluster\u2019s computing nodes for better communications, Amazon said Tuesday. The service retains the same general philosophy, though: customers pay as they go, with more usage incurring more fees. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tHow fast is it? An 880-node cluster reached 41.82 teraflops, or floating-point operations per second, using the Linpack mathematical speed test. By contrast, the 145th-fastest machine on the most recent \u201cTop500\u201d list of the fastest supercomputers reached a sustained speed of 41.88 teraflops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe service is sold on the basis of much smaller nodes than what was used in Amazon\u2019s test: a server with two quad-core Intel X5570 Nehalem Xeon processors. Each such instance costs $1.60 per hour to use. Alternatively, with a payment of $4,290 for one year or $6,590 for three years, the per-hour fee drops to 56 cents.",

The event has a pure focus on the European public sector, segmented into government, European Union and the education and healthcare sectors. The turnout surpassed the previous edition. Arjan Timmers and Jeroen Jacobs were present and share their observations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year GDPR and cloud adoption were the common threads of the summit, this year digital transformation and digital government were the central theme. The summit opened with a keynote from Terresa Carlson, head of AWS Public Sector Global. She explained how AWS supports the public sector in adopting cloud technology in order to grow into a &ldquo;digital government&rdquo;. More and more often, a cloud first strategy is also used in the public sector and that is amply substantiated with examples. During her keynote, Carlson launched two new Cloud Innovation Centers (CIC).</p>\r\n",

Previously, presidential campaigns had relied primarily on outside vendors for their software and operations. However, the president's team felt it needed to have faster access to the data it was generating and better control over how the campaign was run. It also wanted to write completely custom software for its volunteers in the field. So, about 18 months before the election, it started assembling a group of programmers to develop software for nearly every part of its operations: website, mailing list management, donations processing, canvassing, and field worker support. I recently had the opportunity to attend a panel of some of the campaign's lead developers and speak with them one on one.",

    "description": "Article Excerpt: \r\n\u201cBusinesses and researchers have long been utilizing Amazon EC2 to run highly parallel workloads ranging from genomics sequence analysis and automotive design to financial modeling,\u201d said Peter De Santis, general manager of Amazon EC2, in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, these customers have told us that many of their largest, most complex workloads required additional network performance. Cluster Compute Instances provide network latency and bandwidth that previously could only be obtained with expensive, capital intensive, custom-built compute clusters. For perspective, in our last pre-production test run, we saw an 880 server sub-cluster achieve a network rate of 40.62 TFlops \u2013 we\u2019re excited that Amazon EC2 customers now have access to this type of HPC performance with the low per-hour pricing, elasticity, and functionality they have come to expect from Amazon EC2.\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\n\tCluster Compute Instances complement other AWS offerings designed to make large-scale computing easier and more cost effective, Amazon officials said.  For example, Public Data Sets on AWS provide a repository of useful public data sets that can be easily accessed from Amazon EC2, allowing fast, cost-effective data analysis by researchers and businesses, Amazon said in its press release. These large data sets are hosted on AWS at no charge to the community. Additionally, the Amazon Elastic MapReduce service enables low-friction, cost effective implementation of the Hadoop framework on Amazon EC2. Hadoop is a popular tool for analyzing very large data sets in a highly parallel environment, and Amazon EC2 provides the scale-out environment to run Hadoop clusters of all sizes.",

    "description": "<p>The lung scans of coronavirus patients coming out of Wuhan, China had the tell-tale signs of infection. While healthy lungs would usually show up as dark, these were showing the white haziness doctors describe as &ldquo;ground glass&rdquo; on chest x-rays and CT scans, resembling the splintering of a car windshield, and in some cases, a near total whiteout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These patterns in the lungs were familiar to Dr. Savvas Nicolaou, a professor of radiology at the University of British Columbia and the director of emergency and trauma radiology at Vancouver General Hospital in Canada. In the 2000s, he was part of a team that analyzed chest x-rays of SARS patients. When COVID-19 started spreading in January, he teamed up with Dr. William Parker, a radiology resident at the University of British Columbia. Parker is a cofounder of SapienML, a company that has developed software to anonymize medical imaging data, along with Nicolaou and engineer Brian Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three of them had previously worked together on an artificial intelligence model trained on chest x-rays. &ldquo;We thought, well, can we see the findings of COVID-19 in that model?&rdquo; says Parker. They put out a call to collect as many chest x-rays and CT scans as possible to start building an open source AI model analyzing how the disease displays in the lungs, with the goal of developing an alternative way to diagnose patients besides existing tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among those who answered the call to help Parker, Nicolaou and Lee build these CT scan diagnostics? Amazon.</p>\r\n",

Talking with FedScoop, Carlson emphasized the importance of taking risks in the government tech industry, particularly for women. &ldquo;Change in technology happens so quickly, and that speed is only increasing,&rdquo; she said.&rdquo; You have to be on your toes or before you know it, advancements have passed you by and you&rsquo;re spending time playing catch up.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

It&rsquo;s kind of hard to single one out, but Wang thinks AWS deserves our award for its pioneering work in the field.</p>\r\n",

One prominent member of our group, seeking to stake out a bold, contrarian position, asserted that 2011 would be the year that \u201ccloud computing\u201d would be revealed to be a big nothing, an over-hyped concept that in the end is more about marketing than actual technology.\r\nHe\u2019s so, so wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFor starters, the cloud is not quite as mystifying as you might think at first glance. All of the red-hot consumer Internet sites now dominating the conversation about the Web are built on a public cloud infrastructure. Facebook, Zynga, Twitter \u2013 they all rely on public clouds from Amazon.com (AMZN) and others to host their data. As Crosby notes, the public cloud is expanding at an astonishing rate: he says the cloud will quarduple in size over the next two years. The phenomenon is driven by a host of factors, not the least of which is the proliferation of of tablets and smart phones dependent on the cloud to store data. And as Crosby says, consumers have largely come to grips with the security and privacy trade-offs that come with the cool apps the cloud enables.",

    "description": "Article Excerpt:\r\nAmazon today said it would now also offer high-performance computing (HPC) through Cluster Compute Instances, which use more powerful processors and clustered nodes to help get around some of the latency issues associated with distributed computing. HPC has long taken advantage of many nodes working in tandem, but has typically connected those processors using Infiniband or low-latency networks. However, as the need for HPC becomes more popular, and the next generation of faster supercomputers grows more difficult to build (GigaOM Pro sub req\u2019d), the cloud may offer some hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe rise of cloud computing owes a bit to HPC, but for the most part demanding workloads couldn\u2019t take advantage of the cost benefits and flexibility associated with the cloud because of the latency within the cloud and the cost and time associated with moving terabytes of data back and forth from a lab to the cloud. Amazon has solved the data problem by using the postal service and also by acting as a free repository for some types of scientifically valuable information.",

However, Amazon is layering its PaaS offering on top of its other services in a way that\u2019s easily reversed, which means developers can take the easy way out of developing on Beanstalk, or they can peel back the platform to manually provision and tweak their underlying VMs if they want. \r\nAmazon\u2019s next move will be expanding beyond Java, something it could do via partnerships with other providers or on its own. Brian White, a developer with AWS, said PHP and Ruby are high on Amazon\u2019s list, but declined to specify how partnerships with other providers might look. When asked about competing with other PaaS providers who host their platforms on AWS infrastructure, Selipsky suggested that perhaps those might become partners for supporting other languages.",

    "description": "<p style=\"margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in\">Every summer, just before the monsoon season begins in India, pictures like these appear in Indian newspapers or TV. But these could well be images shot in Ethiopia or another impoverished or drought-affected nation. Most of us do not see women and children walking several kilometers each day to fetch water from a distant well or lake. With pots stacked on their heads and cans strapped to cattle, they spend much time collecting water every day, and that&rsquo;s one reason children do not attend school. The water at that resource is usually not potable and causes water-borne diseases. Around the world, 785 million people do not have access to clean water. It&rsquo;s quite common to see cattle and humans consuming water from the same resource in India. While there is groundwater or water in wells, it takes a considerable effort to draw it out from the ground, as pumps are few in number or broken. A successful project undertaken by non-profit Charity: water in Ethiopia could be the solution to this problem. The project uses smart pumps with IoT enabled devices and cloud analytics. The IoT devices are designed by AWS partner Twisthink, an innovation design firm. And the cloud services are provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services). There is a partner ecosystem that handles other aspects of the project, like distribution, installation, and maintenance of the water pumps.</p>\r\n",

The officer took a screenshot of the image, which she later fed into a tool created by nonprofit Thorn to help investigators find underage sex-trafficking victims. The tool, called Spotlight, uses text- and image-processing algorithms to match faces and other clues in online sex ads with other evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using Amazon&rsquo;s facial recognition technology, Spotlight quickly returned a list of online sex ads featuring the girl&rsquo;s photo. She had been sold for weeks. The ads set in motion some more traditional police work. &ldquo;Within weeks that child was recovered and removed from trauma,&rdquo; Julie Cordua, CEO of Thorn, said, recounting the case at an Amazon conference in Las Vegas this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rescue illustrates Thorn&rsquo;s strategy of nurturing new technology to combat child sex-trafficking and exploitation online. The nonprofit was cofounded in 2009 by actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher and has become influential with both law enforcement&mdash;who can use Spotlight and other tools for free&mdash;and the tech industry.

    "description": "<p>University of Georgia (UGA) has brought many lecture-based courses online, but lab-based physical sciences and physical education posed a challenge to the distance-learning environment. UGA did not have access to physical servers, so working with AWS gave us flexibility and a robust set of tools to support our efforts. The open, well-documented and user-friendly API, as well as the server-less architecture provided by AWS Lambda, were a perfect fit because they allowed us to build an application that runs only when needed, which mitigates overhead costs for the class.</p>\r\n",

In some ways, the letter reads like a short management self-help book (2018, 2017). Bezos touted the &ldquo;power of wandering&rdquo; and curiosity in a section largely dominated by AWS. Bezos said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Much of what we build at AWS is based on listening to customers. It&rsquo;s critical to ask customers what they want, listen carefully to their answers, and figure out a plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly (speed matters in business!). No business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession. But it&rsquo;s also not enough. The biggest needle movers will be things that customers don&rsquo;t know to ask for. We must invent on their behalf. We have to tap into our own inner imagination about what&rsquo;s possible.</p>\r\n",

Perhaps you had to sort through thousands of articles looking for something specific, or you had to transcribe hours of audio recordings, or you had to check for duplicate records in a database of thousands of entries. Or perhaps you saw an opportunity in the market that would have required you to mobilize hundreds of people to help you in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\n Until now, you've had three choices: hire temporary workers, which can be messy and inefficient, overburden your staff or, worse, let the opportunity slip away.\r\nThat's why Mechanical Turk, the web service from Amazon.com, one of the most trusted brands online, is so interesting to business owners. Mechanical Turk is an online marketplace for temporary workers. Using your Amazon account, you can hire workers to complete tasks that a computer can't do efficiently.",

The low-hanging fruit is disaster recovery, as well as any migration to the cloud required to bring more capacity online by allocating additional VMs.\r\n\r\nThe process is pretty simple. \u201cTo import images, IT departments use Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) API tools to point to a virtual machine image in their existing environment. Next, they specify the amount of compute capacity they need and where they want to run the image in Amazon\u2019s cloud platform. VM Import will then automatically transfer the image file, migrate the image, and create the instance in Amazon\u2019s cloud,\u201d says Amazon.com.",

Teams across the company began to realize that Alexa could be a useful voice service for their pet projects too. &ldquo;So all that data and technology comes together, even though we are very big on single-threaded ownership,&rdquo; Prasad says. First other Amazon products began integrating into Alexa: When you speak into your Alexa device you can access Amazon Music, Prime Video, your personal recommendations from the main shopping website, and other services. Then the technology began hopscotching through other Amazon domains. &ldquo;Once we had the foundational speech capacity, we were able to bring it to non-Alexa products like Fire TV, voice shopping, the Dash wand for Amazon fresh, and, ultimately, AWS,&rdquo; Lindsay says.<br />\r\n<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br />\r\n<!--[endif]--></p>\r\n",

With global cloud expertise and unmatched reliability, security, and performance, AWS in combination with LG CNS&rsquo;s leadership in building and operating domestic IT systems, will help Korean businesses plan for, and execute effective migration strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, LG CNS will launch a program that provides methodology, training, and consultation services to help companies move 50 applications in 50 days. LG CNS expects to migrate 50 of its own internal applications and workloads to AWS. It will then apply the same practice to drive the digital transformation projects within companies in LG Group and other domestic customers and expand the business to the Asia Pacific market. LG CNS and AWS will also explore opportunities to accelerate innovation by creating new solutions in emerging fields such as 5G, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Internet of Things, and Smart Factory.</p>\r\n",

In order to build the most modern applications faster and easier, algorithms that support almost infinite amounts of data are necessary. This role is fulfilled by the scalability function, characteristic for Amazon SageMaker solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon SageMaker algorithms adopt a streaming computational model that allows you to process an infinite amount of data. The algorithm only passes over the dataset one time and assumes a fixed-memory footprint. This solution precludes storage, shuffling and repeated reading of data, as well as random access to individual records. In addition, streaming algorithms natively capture data from ephemeral sources, whereas traditional machine-learning algorithms usually retrieve data from persistent sources such as local disks.</p>\r\n",

The more data migrate to the cloud, the more innovation we will see in the business areas and areas where we never expect it to happen. Now cloud computing is not an optional but an essential infrastructure for businesses,&rdquo; said Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, Vice President for Amazon S3 in an interview with Maeil Business Newspaper on March 13. She highlighted cloud technology as a key enabler to drive innovation for the next 5-10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec is responsible for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), the world&rsquo;s first cloud storage service launched 13 years ago by AWS. This service is expanding its scope beyond simple data storage to data collection and analytics. What makes Amazon S3 outstanding in the market is that the technical expertise and know-how have been built for more than a decade by working with many customers. Today business agility and flexibility obtained through cloud migration have become essential for companies of all sizes to survive in the market. If you merely think of cloud adoption as a way for cost reduction or do not even consider it, you will inevitably fall behind and lose competitive edge because it means you will miss enormous opportunities that cloud adoption will bring, such as drawing more business insights and spurring innovation for new features, services and products by analyzing the data on cloud.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The latest, available today: New calendar controls that let Alexa schedule meetings based on mutual availability or reschedule them if someone gets double-booked. The new features let Alexa take things a step further. For instance, if you&#39;re trying to set up a one-on-one appointment with a contact who&#39;s also shared calendar data with Amazon, Alexa will scan both of your schedules and suggest a time that&#39;d work for both of you. You can also move a meeting now without needing to delete it and create a new one -- just say something like, &quot;Alexa, move my meeting with Kate from 1:00 to 3:00.&quot; If doing so would leave you double-booked, Alexa will give you a heads-up.</p>\r\n",

Incumbents mean to protect millions or billions of dollars in their revenue from poaching by edge upstarts. Companies new and old are developing relevant hardware and software.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<p>Social-network innovator Nextdoor is running its big-data and analytics solution on AWS, resulting in a 20 percent conversion on notifications&mdash;a key indicator of customer use&mdash;along with a 15 percent increase in unique content viewed per member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The free and popular service is available in more than 115,000 neighborhoods across the country and growing every day. But that growth posed challenges for the company, so it turned to AWS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our members and city agencies are increasingly using Nextdoor for time-critical updates for disaster recovery, crime and safety, local events, and more,&rdquo; says Prakash Janakiraman, Nextdoor&rsquo;s cofounder and chief architect. &ldquo;Managing the increasing volume of content and email-push notifications became unwieldy for members. We wanted to improve the user experience by routing only the &lsquo;best&rsquo; content notifications more effectively, which required us to examine and respond to behavioral data in real time. It had to be easy to operate and to understand, extend, and scale.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nextdoor used machine learning models, Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic MapReduce, AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and Spark to create a &ldquo;trending post&rdquo; feature that notifies users of the top daily discussion in their neighborhood. Data is analyzed, transformed, and deposited into an Amazon DynamoDB data store that can be accessed by live production systems. Notification systems then read aggregate data and determine who should be notified. Additionally, the company found ways to improve its newsfeed experience by prioritizing more &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; conversations above others.</p>\r\n",

But the arrival of cloud computing \u2013 which transforms computer processing, data storage, and software applications into utilities served up by central plants \u2013 marks a fundamental change in the economics of computing. It pushes down the price and expands the availability of computing in a way that effectively removes, or at least radically diminishes, capacity constraints on users.\u201d \r\n\r\n\u201cMy favorite example, which is about a year old now, is both simple and revealing. In late 2007, the New York Times faced a challenge.

To get started, a developer uploads a Java application to Elastic Beanstalk, which automatically handles the deployment details like provisioning compute capacity, load balancing between servers, autoscaling up and down, and monitoring the health of the application.\r\n\r\nOnce a customer uploads the Java app, it will be up and running online in a matter of minutes, [said Adam Selipsky, vice president of Amazon Web Services]. \u201cIf they so choose, they never have to worry again about the underlying infrastructure that is making that app live to the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, Beanstalk also allows users to fine-tune the underlying services, helping to set AWS apart from some other offerings on the market, Selipsky said. \u201cA lot of the platform-as-a-service offerings reduce the amount of programming you have to do but they make choices for you and force you to live with all the decisions predetermined by the vendor,\u201d he said.",

But the company rebranded from Read it Later way back in 2012 for good reason: It doesn&rsquo;t want to be limited to words, seeking instead to be associated with all manner of content &mdash; from videos to images and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular users will know that Pocket has offered a &ldquo;Listen&rdquo; function for a while &mdash; you hit the little headphone button at the top of the screen and a voice reads out your pocketed articles in order. But this text-to-speech functionality leaves a lot to be desired &mdash; for starters, the voice is a little too robotic and not entirely pleasing to the ear. Moving forward, however, those using Pocket on Android and iOS devices will experience human-like dulcet tones, thanks to an integration with the Amazon Polly text-to-speech service.</p>\r\n",

For those responsible for IT, one of the decisive factors for success is precise monitoring of the cloud environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vehicles, real estate, insurance, financial products - dealers can provide a broad portfolio via the online marketplaces of Scout24 AG. The portal operator began moving its infrastructures to the cloud early on. The migration from AutoScout24 to a platform from Amazon Web Services (AWS) started in 2014. With the relocation of ImmobilienScout24, the company initiated another major project, this time with a completely new strategy. In contrast to the AutoScout24 migration, the following applies to the real estate portal: first move, then optimize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CIOs rarely have to come up with the art of persuasion when they want to move IT infrastructure to the cloud: Advantages such as high reliability, the versatile possibilities for automation, comprehensive recovery functions or cost transparency thanks to the pay-per-use model speak for themselves. The same applies to Scout24: &ldquo;The relocation of ImmobilienScout24 to the AWS cloud gives us significantly more flexibility. High pre-financing costs or excessive hardware investments are no longer an issue for us,&rdquo; explains Johannes Br&uuml;ck, Principal Platform Engineer at Scout24. The IT professional sees an additional bonus in the high speed with which the Scout24 development teams can now develop new products. Scout24 relies on agile development processes, which not only require flexibility in the work processes, but also in the underlying infrastructures.</p>\r\n",

But today\u2019s use of the phrase is more specific than simply a great big network in the sky. Understanding the cloud will determine whether it helps organizations realize the efficiencies and cost savings it promises or the opportunities that float on by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form, cloud computing enables organizations to purchase computing power and data storage services from third-party providers who offer these products via the Internet. Rather than investing in their own data centers or servers, businesses and agencies can pay as they go, which allows them to expand\u2014or contract\u2014as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis business model offers several benefits; among the most attractive are lower upfront costs and increased agility. Organizations no longer have to predict how many servers they may need when their business grows. Yet, when an organization\u2019s growth exceeds expectations, the server capacity it needs to succeed can be in place in minutes rather than weeks.",

In healthcare, however, the importance of data cannot be understated. &ldquo;Healthcare data is particularly sensitive,&rdquo; said Amazon Web Service (AWS) Global Technical Leader for Healthcare and Life Sciences Patrick Combes in the recent ITWC-hosted webinar Storing, Protecting and Optimizing Healthcare Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putting aside the general concern that public cloud means data is necessarily public and therefore more vulnerable, healthcare data is highly valuable, especially when you compare it to other kinds of data. While financial data, said Combes, can be breached and trafficked on the dark web for relatively small amounts of money, medical data, which contains information about everything that&rsquo;s unique to you, is very expensive.</p>\r\n",

Each group exerts influence over cloud evolution, and the cloud shapes the needs of customers and the direction of technology transformation. Cloud improvements might make traditional data storage and retrieval activities become less visible, fading into a cloud of usage analogous to 19th-century military thinker Carl von Clausewitz&rsquo;s fog of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nature of the cloud lends itself to technology development, as it can serve as a giant test bed for datacentric applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are two disciplines that already are exploiting the cloud&rsquo;s features, and other applications are emerging. In turn, the appearance of innovative uses is influencing the cloud, and that influence is likely to increase as momentum builds to explore further applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the power of a software-defined infrastructure,&rdquo; asserts Mark Ryland, director, Office of the Chief Information Security Officer at Amazon Web Services (AWS). &ldquo;It enables a small number of clever programmers to build out systems that would have been impossible without an army of people buying and deploying hardware.</p>\r\n",

Sure, Amazon Web Services can point to 64,000 database migrations over the last two years, but that still leaves millions more stuck in corporate datacenters. But not, it would appear, for long. Ryanair, Europe&rsquo;s largest airline, <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsaws&amp;nyo=0\">just signaled</a> a significant shift in cloud migrations, announcing that it is &ldquo;going all-in&rdquo; on AWS, moving its infrastructure to the cloud leader.

AWS doesn&rsquo;t open local numbers, but a national event hosted in S&atilde;o Paulo allows us to have a feel of the width of the businesses in the country. 22,000 registered and 8,500 simultaneous participants followed talks about success cases and the applicability of the solutions offered by the cloud branch at Amazon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eighth Brazilian edition of the AWS Summit was opened with statements of the local importance for the company&rsquo;s business. On stage, the vice president for sales in Latin America, Greg Pearsons, stated that the region &ldquo;has a pivotal role in this moment of cloud, more specifically Brazil, with many large companies and brands moving their operations to the cloud&rdquo;. Besides the focus on digital transformation, Pearsons also highlighted cloud natives, like Nubank, a Brazilian fintech which figured among the ten largest digital banks in the world, the largest outside of Asia.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "This spring, a startup called Makara came out of stealth mode with a beta of a product called Cloud Application Platform, which as the name suggests allowed companies to set up private platform clouds like Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine, or Engine Yard internally on their own iron. Today, Makara is doing something that will perhaps be more interesting, which is layering atop Amazon\u2019s EC2 infrastructure cloud to turn it into a platform cloud.\r\nArticle Excerpt:\r\n\r\nNow that Amazon\u2019s EC2 compute cloud can be brought to bear using the Cloud Application Platform, the set of monitoring and management tools that allow customers to manage their private clouds running atop Eucalyptus (KVM), Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (KVM), Red Hat KVM, and VMware vSphere hypervisors and cloud frameworks can now be used to manage EC2 images.\r\n\r\nIn fact, says Isaac Roth, co-founder and chief executive officer at Makara, the whole point of the Cloud Application Platform is to make the differences between a public cloud and private cloud moot and to abstract both up one layer so companies just worry about the services their applications need to run \u2013 a Web server, a database, and so forth \u2013 and leave the Makara system at work to manage how the underlying infrastructure is scaled up and down.",

    "description": "<p>VMware introduced to its broader ecosystem of partners on Wednesday a professional certification for its joint hybrid cloud product with Amazon Web Services. The latest addition to the VMware Partner Network extends a &quot;tried and true program&quot; to VMware Cloud on AWS to incentivize partners and engender expertise in the service, said Brandon Sweeney, VMware&#39;s senior vice president of worldwide partners and alliances. The service expanded into the U.K. Wednesday and will soon become available in Germany. More than 5,000 firms have formally expressed interest in joining that product&#39;s channel&mdash;many almost immediately after the hybrid cloud product launched last August. It is no surprise a significant number come from the AWS ecosystem; born-in-the-cloud solution providers see VMware Cloud on AWS as a vehicle for extending their practices into the data center for the first time, said Terry Wise, vice president for the AWS worldwide partner ecosystem.</p>\r\n",

Amazon.com began offering services in 2006 and since then, according to technology consultant 451 Group, it has \"almost single-handedly moved cloud computing to the center of the IT innovation agenda.\r\n\r\nWilliam Fellows, principal analyst of the 451 Group, says: \"In terms of market share Amazon is Coke and there isn't yet a Pepsi.\"\r\n\r\nThe type of cloud model pioneered by Amazon has become known as \"infrastructure as a service.\" It describes a procedure whereby a customer rents rather than buys the raw hardware for computer processing and data storage, along with the Internet bandwidth to deliver it. The customer, not the provider, is responsible for the operating system and software to run on it.",

An architecture review is a good way to determine whether Best Practices are being followed and whether there are any risks in the architecture. The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architects develop secure, high-performance, resilient, and efficient infrastructures for their applications. This article shows how the concepts from the Well-Architected Framework can be put into practice. In doing so, the authors will also address the concerns of IT managers from German SMEs using anecdotes and Best Practices from the industry.</p>\r\n",

Since 2011, 20,000 entrepreneurs have moved into the city for a capital increase of $13.11 billion and sales revenue of $154 billion, the statement says.

A survey of its customers conducted by AWS last year concluded that a major reason why big companies were delaying a move to cloud computing was due to the painstaking process of making sure those new cloud-based application environments were compliant with industry regulations or government requirements, and if there&rsquo;s one thing that tech executives like to do, it&rsquo;s automate things, Plato said in a recent interview with GeekWire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At its annual re:Invent conference last year, AWS announced a new ATO (Authority to Operate) service with dozens of partners, including Anitian, designed to make it easier and faster to obtain certifications such as FedRAMP and PCI that are required to do business with the U.S. government. Soon after that, after being shown a demonstration of Anitian&rsquo;s product, one tech executive told Plato &ldquo;you guys solved a really big problem that haunts every shop I&rsquo;ve ever worked in,&rdquo; he recalled.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Article Excerpts:\r\n\u201cThe current private cloud model that requires companies to invest heavily in virtualization and maintaining their own data centers is not a \u201creal cloud\u201d model, according to an Amazon executive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAndy Jassy, senior vice president of Amazon Web Services (AWS), argued that the current model of private clouds does not provide the capital expenditure (capex) savings and scalability of a true cloud offering. AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\u201cCompanies usually are not able to provision accurately the amount of data center capacity that they require, and this problem recurs when they create their own internal cloud infrastructure,\u201d said Jassy, who was in town Thursday for the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) Distinguished Infocomm Speaker Series. \r\nHe noted that companies would still have to dedicate a proportion of their IT resources, such as software engineers, to maintain the data centers instead of freeing them up to create products that will differentiate their companies from the competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis runs counter to the definition of cloud computing, which Jassy said constitutes five attributes: changing capex to variable operational costs; a pay-as-you-go payment model; allowing companies to have truly elastic, scalable data center capacity, fast product time-to-market; and reducing the focus on hardware management. These attributes are in accordance to Gartner\u2019s definition of cloud computing, he said.\u201d",
