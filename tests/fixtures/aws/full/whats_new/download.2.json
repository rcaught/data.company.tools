This integration enables administrators to leverage IAM security features such as audit logging and multi-factor authentication. EKS access management controls introduced today simplify the process of mapping IAM to Kubernetes identities, by allowing administrators to fully define authorized IAM principals and their associated Kubernetes permissions directly through an EKS API during or after cluster creation. The IAM identity used to create a EKS cluster can have its Kubernetes permissions removed or scoped down to comply with security requirements, and control of a cluster can always be restored to an AWS account administrator. Other AWS services can use EKS access management controls to automatically obtain permissions to run applications on EKS clusters.
